email alert:
1. The customer of UPS can register their account in the UPS web with their email address. 

2. When their own package has received, the owner will receieve an email telling them their package has been delivered. 

3. The email alert is meant to be real-time. The frontend will run this task in a parallel thread to avoid django web runs in a blocking manner.

4. Every ten seconds, the front-end will search the table in database which records delivered package. The interval time can change according to the simulation speed.

5. Once the frontend discovered a delivered package, it will send email to the owner of the package and then delete that record from table.
